Description
-----------

Design, operation, and management of traffic flows over complex transportation networks. Covers two major topics: traffic flow modeling and traffic flow operations. Includes deterministic and probabilistic models, elements of queueing theory, and traffic assignment. Concepts and methods are illustrated through various applications and examples.

Requirements
------------

You are responsible for completing three and a half problem sets and one quiz. Unless otherwise instructed, the writing of the assignments is required to be individual.

Grades
------

Problem Sets: 70% (you may use a one time 48-hour extension)  
Quiz: 30%

Readings
--------

There is no textbook that completely covers the material of the subject.Â Additional materials will be given out in class.

The Five Twos in 1.225
----------------------

*   Two type of flows: **Air** and **Road**
*   Two types of problems: **Modeling** and **Operation** Problems
*   Two levels of analyses: **Component** Level and **Network** Level
*   Two time-scale of analyses: **Static** vs. **Dynamic**
*   Two type of approaches/tools: **Analytical** and **Simulation-based**

Academic Honesty
----------------

The MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering adheres to the strictest standards of academic honesty. An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty as regards academic honesty. This statement is an attempt to clarify the faculty's expectations in this subject.

Assignments
-----------

Assignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, apply to all assignments.

Students currently taking this class can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes text, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs and output, references, and any written source you use in your submission. It is inappropriate to use assignments submitted in previous years as a source.

Quiz
----

All work on a quiz should be performed only by you.

If you have any questions about how these policies relate to a specific situation, you should speak to Professor Chabini or Professor Odoni for clarification.
